# Overclock-Website

This is a website version for our university social media project 'Linking You'.

The project aims to provide a platform for Wits (University of the Witwaterstrand) students to access different societies and clubs for Wits students.

Anyone can signup as a user using an email address and even request to create their own group (CSI).
Users can subscribe to these CSIs and even take part in discussions using that CSIs forum.
